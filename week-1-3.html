          <p class="step-1-define-the-style-of-th">
            In Figma, start by creating frames for each section of the web page.
            Use the dimensions of a 1440 wide PC frame as a reference. Naming
            the frames appropriately will help you stay organized throughout the
            design process.

          <p class="before-starting-the-design-pro">
            To maintain consistency and efficiency, create components for
            reusable elements such as headers, footers, buttons, and navigation
            bars. Components allow you to make changes in one place and have
            them reflected across the entire design.

          <p class="step-1-define-the-style-of-th">
            Figma provides a layout tool that helps you position and align
            components within the frames. Utilize this tool to ensure proper
            spacing, alignment, and overall visual harmony in your design.

          </p>
          <p class="step-1-define-the-style-of-th">
            Once you have designed the Home Page, repeat the same process for
            the remaining sections of the web page, such as Team Members, Work
            Projects, and Final Project. Maintain a consistent style and layout
            throughout the entire design.

          <p class="step-1-define-the-style-of-th">
            By following these steps, you can create a great and professional
            web page design in Figma. Remember to regularly save your progress
            and iterate on the design as needed to achieve the desired outcome.
