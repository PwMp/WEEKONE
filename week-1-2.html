              <p class="step-1-setting-the-vision">
                First things first, we needed a cool idea to connect all our
                projects on the website. So, we came up with this awesome
                concept. It's like having a theme that ties everything together,
                making it more interesting to the user. We decided to create a
                character. But here's the cool part: we used AI (that's
                artificial intelligence) to make this character.

                AI, you can read our detailed explanation here.

              <p class="step-1-setting-the-vision">
                Before diving into creating a character using Leonardo AI, it's
                essential to establish a clear vision of what we want our
                character to look like. Consider the character's appearance,
                style, and personality. Having a well-defined concept will guide
                the AI's creative process effectively.

              </p>
              <p class="step-1-setting-the-vision">
                Once you choose the AI Image Generation option, you have the
                opportunity to communicate your vision to Leonardo AI. You can
                specify details such as the character's features, color palette,
                and any specific design elements you want to incorporate. This
                input will act as the foundation for the AI's creative process.

              <p class="step-1-setting-the-vision">
                After the AI generates the initial character, you can assess its
                design and make refinements as needed. This step allows you to
                fine-tune details, adjust the character's appearance, and ensure
                it perfectly aligns with your vision.

              <p class="step-1-setting-the-vision">
                Leonardo AI employs a complex neural network to transform your
                input into a visual representation. The AI's algorithms analyze
                your instructions and begin generating a character that aligns
                with your vision. This process might take a few moments,
                depending on the complexity of your request.

                Once you are satisfied with the character's design, you can
                export it in your preferred file format. Leonardo AI provides
                options for various file types, ensuring compatibility with your
                intended application.

                Now that you have your character, you can seamlessly integrate
                it into your project. Whether it's for a website, game, or any
                other application, your AI-generated character will add a unique
                and engaging element to your work.

                breathing life into your creative visions. By following these
                steps, you can harness the capabilities of artificial
                intelligence to design a character that aligns perfectly with
                your project's needs and requirements.
